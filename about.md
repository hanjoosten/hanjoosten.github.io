I studied computer science at [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/). After a couple of years in an R&D job at KPN, I enroled in the software developement departement. I worked with model driven development tools for over 10 years. In time, I shifted upwards from building software to requirements engineering. For details, see my [linkedin profile](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/hanjoosten) (sorry, in Dutch). Business rules, and more specifically, the translation of these business assets into execution level, is what I am passionate about. 

### Side project

About 10 to 15 years ago I have been infected ;) by an idea of my brother, Stef Joosten, who had this idea to translate business rules into something executable by means of relation algebra. I joined his single man's project, which has evolved into [Ampersand](http://ampersandtarski.github.io/). 

This project has helped me in understand and experiencing a lot of facets of software development in the wild. Things we take for granted (like mature version management, issue management, continuous integration etc) in developing Ampersand, aren't allways obvious for the customers I work for in my daily job as a consultant.
